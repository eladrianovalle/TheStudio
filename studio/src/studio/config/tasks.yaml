steel_man_task:
  description: >
    Take the initial idea: {game_idea} and present its strongest possible form.
    Pre-emptively solve obvious problems.
    
    {previous_feedback}
    
    If this is a revision (iteration > 1), address the contrarian's previous concerns directly.
  expected_output: "A high-conviction proposal document that addresses previous feedback if provided."

attack_task:
  description: >
    Review the proposal. Identify fatal flaws even in this 'best case' version.
    
    This is iteration {iteration} of {max_iterations}.
    
    If you find fatal flaws:
    - Respond with 'VERDICT: REJECTED' followed by numbered fatal flaws
    - Be specific about what needs to change
    
    If the proposal survives scrutiny:
    - Respond with 'VERDICT: APPROVED' followed by your reasoning
  expected_output: "A critical analysis ending with 'VERDICT: APPROVED' or 'VERDICT: REJECTED' with specific reasoning."

studio_vision_task:
  description: >
    Treat the Studio itself as the product. Synthesize the objective: {objective}
    and paint the strongest, most inspiring version of Studio that could exist within
    current constraints. Highlight the user promise, critical capabilities, and how it
    supercharges a solo dev with boundless creativity.
  expected_output: >
    An inspiring north-star brief that frames Studio as the ultimate solo-dev copilot,
    including a headline vision, 3 signature capabilities, and a motivating narrative.

studio_constraints_task:
  description: >
    Stress-test the Studio vision against brutally practical limits: budget ceiling {budget_cap},
    available time, maintenance burden, model/API costs, vendor risk, and ops toil.
    Surface concrete blockers, attack hidden costs, and demand scrappy alternatives that keep
    the tool free or extremely cheap to run at all times.
  expected_output: >
    A cost-and-risk deconstruction including a table of threat vectors, mitigation ideas,
    and a sharpened definition of "always available, nearly free" in practice.

studio_integration_task:
  description: >
    Merge the inspiration and the constraints into a pragmatic execution plan that other projects
    can import immediately. Define reusable hooks, automation, observability, and upgrade loops.
    Show how Studio propagates insights back into every repo while keeping spend tiny.
  expected_output: >
    A prioritized roadmap (0-2 weeks, 1-2 months, aspirational) with integration steps, ownership,
    and concrete suggestions for low-cost infra, caching, or local-first patterns.

    2. Player progression system (levels, unlocks, or skill trees)
    3. Key game mechanics (3-5 mechanics with rules)
    4. UI/UX wireframe descriptions (main screens)
    5. Technical constraints checklist (performance, scope, dependencies)
  expected_output: >
    A structured game design document with diagrams and specifications.

tech_implementation_task:
  description: >
    The technical architecture has been APPROVED. Now generate concrete deliverables:
    
    APPROVED ARCHITECTURE: {approved_concept}
    
    Produce:
    1. System architecture diagram (text-based)
    2. Technology stack with justifications
    3. File structure and module organization
    4. Key algorithms or data structures
